<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->

    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br>In this project, I needed to make a poetry website where I needed to find the last message that I sent, which is either to my friend or family member, and put the word on Google Search. There, you copy all the 
      words from the multiple answers in the beginning of the search, and then paste them on your repositories and edit the quote, and then put some images and some coding, and there you have yourself a website you made. 
       So I chose my friend, where my last message was that I sent it to them saying, "It was good," and after copying my last line, I searched it on 
      Google and find multiple responses. When I search, it looks good. Then I simply copy all of the beginning links and paste them on my GitHub repository project. Then 
      I simply made some edits and styled it to make it more interesting and more creative. Then, after finishing my quote , I put some images to make it more fun, and finally, I finished.
     my own website, and to be honest, it was kind of fun. I liked creating my own website, and my classmates, including my teacher, seem to be really interested in what I made, so yeah, it was fun to do and really easy to make!

    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br> Project 2 was a little hard because I needed to make a Zoom video, and I needed to record myself for 1 minute talking about anything. I mean, I saw it as easy.
      But when making the video, you need to download some apps for making a long video, which for me was kind of difficult to do. I had to find the right websites where it's free.
      and not paying it, and to be honest, it was really hard for a while until I had to tell my classmate to help me with this assignment. My classmate did help me by following some steps, and 
      After a few minutes, I finally finished my project and uploaded it to the Google folder, and to be honest, I don't really like this assignment because it was hard, and I don't like making videos about me. 
      because I feel embarrassed seeing myself in a video.
